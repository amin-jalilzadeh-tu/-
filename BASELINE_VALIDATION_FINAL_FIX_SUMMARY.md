# Baseline Validation Fixes - Final Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Date Column Detection (FIXED ✓)
**Problem**: "No date columns found in wide format data"
**Solution**: Updated regex pattern to support both daily and monthly formats
```python
# OLD
date_pattern = r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}'

# NEW  
date_pattern = r'^\d{4}-\d{2}(?:-\d{2})?$'
```

### 2. Year-Agnostic Matching (FIXED ✓)
**Problem**: No overlapping dates between 2013-2014 simulation data and 2020 measured data
**Solution**: Added year-agnostic matching option that matches by month-day only

**Implementation**:
1. Added `year_agnostic_matching` to ValidationConfig class
2. Modified `align_and_validate_mapping()` to support month-day matching
3. When enabled, creates MatchKey with format 'MM-DD' ignoring year

**Usage**:
```python
config = {
    "year_agnostic_matching": True,
    # other config...
}
```

### 3. Remaining Issue: Electricity:Facility Mapping
**Status**: The semantic mapping between "Electricity:Facility [J](Hourly)" and "Electricity:Facility" is failing in baseline validation but works in modified validation.

**Root Cause**: The baseline validation appears to have different mapping logic or the variable is being filtered out before semantic matching occurs.

## Verification Results

With year-agnostic matching enabled:
- ✅ Zone Air System Sensible Cooling Energy - Mapped and aligned (1 data point)
- ✅ Zone Air System Sensible Heating Energy - Mapped and aligned (1 data point)  
- ✅ Zone Mean Air Temperature - Mapped and aligned (1 data point)
- ❌ Electricity:Facility [J](Hourly) - Failed to map

## Configuration Example

```python
# For baseline validation with year-agnostic matching
config = {
    "target_frequency": "monthly",
    "year_agnostic_matching": True,  # Enable year-agnostic matching
    "variables_to_validate": ["Electricity", "Heating", "Cooling", "Temperature"],
    "thresholds": {
        "cvrmse": 25.0,
        "nmbe": 8.0
    }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `/mnt/d/Documents/daily/E_Plus_2040_py/parserr/aggregation_utils.py` (line 206)
   - Fixed date column detection pattern

2. `/mnt/d/Documents/daily/E_Plus_2040_py/validation/smart_validation_wrapper.py`
   - Line 542: Fixed date column detection pattern
   - Line 51: Added `year_agnostic_matching` to ValidationConfig
   - Line 44: Made `target_frequency` work at top level or in aggregation section
   - Lines 1405-1439: Implemented year-agnostic date matching logic

## Current Status

- Baseline validation now works with year-agnostic matching
- Parquet files are being generated successfully
- Three zone variables are mapping and validating correctly
- The Electricity:Facility variable mapping issue remains unresolved

## Next Steps

To fully resolve the Electricity:Facility mapping issue:
1. Investigate why semantic matching works in modified but not baseline validation
2. Check if there's additional filtering happening before semantic matching
3. Consider adding explicit mapping configuration for this variable
