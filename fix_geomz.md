## Prioritized Fix Recommendations

### Issue VENT_001: Core Zone Zero Infiltration
**Fix Priority: CRITICAL**

**Steps to fix:**
1. In `add_ventilation.py`, modify the logic around line 280:

```python
# CURRENT CODE (INCORRECT):
if is_core_zone_curr:
    infiltration_for_this_zone_m3_s = 0.0
else:
    if zone_floor_area_curr_m2 > 1e-6:
        infiltration_L_s = infiltration_rate_at_1Pa_L_s_per_m2_floor_area * zone_floor_area_curr_m2
        infiltration_for_this_zone_m3_s = infiltration_L_s / 1000.0

# FIXED CODE:
# Core zones should have reduced, not zero infiltration
infiltration_reduction_factor = 0.25 if is_core_zone_curr else 1.0
if zone_floor_area_curr_m2 > 1e-6:
    infiltration_L_s = infiltration_rate_at_1Pa_L_s_per_m2_floor_area * zone_floor_area_curr_m2 * infiltration_reduction_factor
    infiltration_for_this_zone_m3_s = infiltration_L_s / 1000.0
else:
    infiltration_for_this_zone_m3_s = 0.0
```

**Pre-fix check:**
- Look for `Design_Flow_Rate = 0` in core zone infiltration objects
- Check CSV results show zero infiltration for core zones

**Post-fix validation:**
- Core zones should have ~25% of perimeter zone infiltration rates
- CSV results should show non-zero infiltration for all zones

### Issue VENT_002: System D Missing Ventilation Objects
**Fix Priority: CRITICAL**

**Steps to fix:**
1. The issue is that System D uses IdealLoadsAirSystem for ventilation, which doesn't create separate ZONEVENTILATION objects. This is actually correct behavior, but the DSOA flow rates need proper configuration.

2. In `add_ventilation.py`, ensure DSOA flow rates are properly set:

```python
# Around line 220, verify this calculation:
if dsoa_obj:
    base_design_rate_L_s_m2 = 0.0
    if bldg_func == "residential":
        base_design_rate_L_s_m2 = 0.9  # This should match expected rates
    else:
        # ... existing code ...
    
    # Add validation:
    dsoa_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2 = (base_design_rate_L_s_m2 * f_ctrl) / 1000.0
    if dsoa_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2 < 1e-6:
        print(f"[WARNING] DSOA flow rate too low: {dsoa_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2}")
    
    dsoa_obj.Outdoor_Air_Flow_per_Zone_Floor_Area = dsoa_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2
```

**Pre-fix check:**
- Check DSOA object has very low or zero flow rates
- IdealLoadsAirSystem has no outdoor air specification

**Post-fix validation:**
- DSOA should have flow rates around 0.0009 mÂ³/s/mÂ² for residential
- Zone Outdoor Air Volume Flow Rate should show non-zero values

### Issue VENT_003: Schedule Pattern Selection
**Fix Priority: HIGH**

**Steps to fix:**
1. In `schedules.py`, add logging to track schedule creation:

```python
def get_or_create_archetype_schedule(
    idf: IDF,
    target_schedule_name: str,
    building_function: str,
    archetype_key: str,
    purpose: str,
    strategy: str,
    schedule_type_limits_name: str = "Fraction"
) -> Tuple[Optional[Any], Optional[ChosenSchedulePattern], Optional[ChosenSchedulePattern]]:
    # Add at the beginning:
    print(f"[SCHEDULE DEBUG] Creating schedule '{target_schedule_name}' for {building_function}/{archetype_key}/{purpose}")
    
    # After pattern lookup:
    if not purpose_patterns:
        print(f"[WARNING] No patterns found, defaulting to AlwaysOn for '{target_schedule_name}'")
    else:
        print(f"[SCHEDULE DEBUG] Found patterns: weekday={bool(ranged_weekday_pattern)}, weekend={bool(ranged_weekend_pattern)}")
```

2. Ensure schedule lookup keys match exactly:

```python
# In schedule_lookup.py, add more specific patterns for missing archetypes
"Two-and-a-half-story House": {  # Add this if missing
    "ventilation": {
        "weekday": [(0, 6, (0.30, 0.50)), (6, 9, (0.80, 1.00)), 
                    (9, 16, (0.40, 0.60)), (16, 22, (0.90, 1.00)), 
                    (22, 24, (0.30, 0.50))],
        "weekend": [(0, 8, (0.40, 0.60)), (8, 23, (0.85, 1.00)), 
                    (23, 24, (0.40, 0.60))],
    },
    "infiltration": {
        "allday": [(0, 24, (0.90, 1.00))],
    }
},
```

**Pre-fix check:**
- Schedule objects show constant values
- No time-varying patterns in schedule definitions

**Post-fix validation:**
- Schedule:Compact objects should have varying values throughout the day
- CSV results should show hourly variation in ventilation rates

### Issue VENT_004: Unit Conversion Verification
**Fix Priority: HIGH**

**Steps to fix:**
1. Add explicit unit tracking in `calc_functions.py`:

```python
def calc_infiltration_rate_at_1Pa_per_m2(
    infiltration_base_at_10Pa_per_m2,  # L/s/m2
    year_factor,
    flow_exponent
):
    """
    UNITS: Input in L/s/m2, Output in L/s/m2
    The conversion to m3/s happens in the calling function.
    """
    # Add validation
    if infiltration_base_at_10Pa_per_m2 > 10.0:
        print(f"[WARNING] Unusually high infiltration base rate: {infiltration_base_at_10Pa_per_m2} L/s/m2")
    
    # ... existing calculation ...
    
    # Add output validation
    if qv1_effective_per_m2 > 5.0:
        print(f"[WARNING] Calculated infiltration rate seems high: {qv1_effective_per_m2} L/s/m2")
    
    return qv1_effective_per_m2
```

2. In `add_ventilation.py`, ensure unit conversions are explicit:

```python
# Around line 250, make conversion explicit:
infiltration_L_s = infiltration_rate_at_1Pa_L_s_per_m2_floor_area * zone_floor_area_curr_m2
infiltration_for_this_zone_m3_s = infiltration_L_s / 1000.0  # L/s to m3/s

print(f"[UNIT CHECK] Zone {zone_name_curr}: {infiltration_L_s:.2f} L/s = {infiltration_for_this_zone_m3_s:.6f} m3/s")
```

**Pre-fix check:**
- Compare hand calculations with IDF values
- Look for values off by factors of 1000

**Post-fix validation:**
- IDF Design_Flow_Rate values should be in reasonable range (0.0001-0.001 mÂ³/s/mÂ²)
- Total building ventilation should match expected values

These fixes address the most critical issues in the ventilation system implementation. After applying these changes, the simulation results should show more realistic ventilation and infiltration patterns that vary appropriately with building type, zone location, and time of day.











## Deep Dive Analysis: Additional Critical Issues in Ventilation System

After a thorough analysis of the code and IDF outputs, I've identified several more critical issues that are causing unrealistic simulation results:

### Additional Critical Issues Found

```yaml
DEEP_ANALYSIS_ISSUES:
  
  Issue_VENT_007: Weather Coefficients Applied to Wrong Field
    Detection:
      - Code: apply_weather_coefficients() modifies Design_Flow_Rate
      - IDF: Shows very low Design_Flow_Rate values (e.g., 7.075174e-05)
      - Impact: Infiltration rates 5-10x lower than intended
    Root_Cause:
      - The function divides base flow by coefficient sum
      - This creates a "k" value instead of actual flow rate
      - EnergyPlus expects actual m3/s/m2, not a coefficient
    
  Issue_VENT_008: System D Creates No Ventilation Objects
    Detection:
      - IDF: No ZONEVENTILATION objects for System D buildings
      - CSV: Zone Ventilation Standard Density Volume = 0
      - But IdealLoads doesn't report ventilation separately
    Root_Cause:
      - System D relies entirely on IdealLoads + DSOA
      - No separate ventilation reporting mechanism
      - Ventilation energy hidden in ideal loads heating/cooling
  
  Issue_VENT_009: Schedule Strategy Not Propagated Correctly
    Detection:
      - Code: Strategy "A" used for parameter selection
      - Schedule: Always picks midpoint regardless of strategy
      - Impact: No variation between buildings of same type
    Root_Cause:
      - parameter_pick_strategy passed but not used consistently
      - _pick_value_from_range() receives strategy correctly
      - But schedule patterns don't vary as expected
  
  Issue_VENT_010: Non-Residential Infiltration Incorrectly High During Operation
    Detection:
      - Schedule shows (0.25, 0.45) during occupied hours
      - Should be lower when HVAC pressurizes building
      - Results in 2x infiltration during operation
    Root_Cause:
      - schedule_lookup.py has inverted logic
      - Low values should be during operation, not off-hours
  
  Issue_VENT_011: Zone Area Fallback Creates Equal Distribution
    Detection:
      - When zone areas unavailable, splits equally
      - Core zones get same ventilation as perimeter
      - Violates thermal zoning principles
    Root_Cause:
      - No consideration of zone type in fallback
      - Should estimate based on building geometry
  
  Issue_VENT_012: DSOA Method Set to "Sum" Instead of "Flow/Area"
    Detection:
      - IDF: DSOA_Global has Outdoor_Air_Method = "Sum"
      - But only Flow/Area is populated
      - May cause E+ to ignore the specification
    Root_Cause:
      - Mismatch between method and populated fields
      - Should be "Flow/Area" to match data provided
  
  Issue_VENT_013: Natural Ventilation Uses Constant Coefficients
    Detection:
      - System A (Natural) has all coefficients = 1,0,0,0
      - No temperature or wind dependence
      - Unrealistic constant natural ventilation
    Root_Cause:
      - create_ventilation_systems.py line ~240
      - Sets constant coefficients for natural ventilation
      - Should have temperature/wind sensitivity
  
  Issue_VENT_014: HRV Effectiveness Applied to Wrong System Types
    Detection:
      - Only System D should have HRV
      - But parameters exist for all systems
      - May cause confusion in results
    Root_Cause:
      - No validation that HRV only applies to System D
      - Other systems shouldn't have these parameters
  
  Issue_VENT_015: Missing Minimum Ventilation Enforcement
    Detection:
      - calc_required_ventilation_flow has 126 m3/h minimum
      - But this is building-level, not zone-level
      - Small zones may get near-zero ventilation
    Root_Cause:
      - Minimum only applied at building level
      - Zone distribution doesn't respect minimums
      - Should have zone-level minimums too
```

## Detailed Deep-Dive Findings

### 1. Weather Coefficient Mathematical Error (VENT_007)
**Severity: CRITICAL**

Looking at `create_ventilation_systems.py`:

```python
def apply_weather_coefficients(infil_obj, base_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2, typical_delta_t=10.0, typical_wind=3.0):
    A, B, C, D = 0.5, 0.02, 0.04, 0.0
    denom = A + B * typical_delta_t + C * typical_wind + D * (typical_wind ** 2)
    infil_obj.Design_Flow_Rate = base_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2 / denom  # THIS IS WRONG!
```

**Problem**: This creates a coefficient 'k' where Q = k Ã (A + BÃÎT + CÃv + DÃvÂ²)

But EnergyPlus expects: `Design_Flow_Rate = Actual flow rate at design conditions`

**Evidence in IDF**:
```
ZONEINFILTRATION:DESIGNFLOWRATE,
    Infil_resi_D_Zone1_RightPerimeter,
    Zone1_RightPerimeter,
    InfilSched_Twoandahalfstory_House,
    Flow/Area,
    3.537587e-04,  !- This is correct (0.354 L/s/mÂ² = 0.000354 mÂ³/s/mÂ²)
```

But with weather model, it would show:
```
    7.075174e-05,  !- This is 5x too low!
```

### 2. System Type Logic Flaws (VENT_008, VENT_013)

**System A (Natural) Problem**:
```python
# In create_ventilation_systems.py for Natural ventilation:
vobj.Design_Flow_Rate = max(0.0, ventilation_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2)
# But then:
if hasattr(vobj, "Ventilation_Type"):
    vobj.Ventilation_Type = "Natural"
# And coefficients:
    1,  # Constant Term - THIS MEANS NO VARIATION!
    0,  # Temperature Term
    0,  # Velocity Term
```

Natural ventilation should vary with outdoor conditions!

**System D Problem**:
- Uses IdealLoads but no separate ventilation tracking
- DSOA configuration issues
- No way to verify ventilation is actually happening

### 3. Schedule Logic Inversion (VENT_010)

In `schedule_lookup.py`:
```python
"Office Function": {
    "infiltration": {
        "weekday": [(0, 7, (0.80, 1.00)),   # HIGH when unoccupied - CORRECT
                    (7, 18, (0.30, 0.50)),   # LOW when occupied - WRONG!
                    (18, 24, (0.80, 1.00))], # HIGH when unoccupied - CORRECT
```

**The problem**: Comments say "Suppressed by HVAC pressure during day" but values are still significant (0.30-0.50). For a pressurized building, infiltration during operation should be much lower (0.05-0.20).

### 4. Zone Distribution Logic Issues (VENT_011, VENT_015)

```python
# In add_ventilation.py around line 290:
if final_total_area_for_proportions > 1e-6 and zone_floor_area_curr_m2 >= 0:
    proportion = zone_floor_area_curr_m2 / final_total_area_for_proportions
    ventilation_for_this_zone_m3_s = vent_flow_m3_s_total_building * proportion
```

**Problems**:
1. No minimum ventilation per zone
2. Core zones might need different ventilation rates
3. No consideration of zone usage or occupancy density

### 5. DSOA Configuration Error (VENT_012)

```python
# In add_ventilation.py:
dsoa_obj = idf.newidfobject("DESIGNSPECIFICATION:OUTDOORAIR", Name=dsoa_object_name_global)
dsoa_obj.Outdoor_Air_Method = "Sum"  # WRONG!
# But then only sets:
dsoa_obj.Outdoor_Air_Flow_per_Zone_Floor_Area = dsoa_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2
```

Should be:
```python
dsoa_obj.Outdoor_Air_Method = "Flow/Area"
```

def apply_weather_coefficients(infil_obj, base_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2, typical_delta_t=10.0, typical_wind=3.0):
    """Configure weather-dependent infiltration correctly."""
    # These coefficients should multiply the base flow rate
    A, B, C, D = 0.0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.0  # A=0 for pure weather dependence
    
    # The Design_Flow_Rate should be the base rate
    infil_obj.Design_Flow_Rate = base_flow_per_area_m3_s_m2
    
    # Coefficients normalized so that at typical conditions, multiplier â 1.0
    total_at_typical = A + B * typical_delta_t + C * typical_wind
    
    if total_at_typical > 0:
        infil_obj.Constant_Term_Coefficient = A / total_at_typical
        infil_obj.Temperature_Term_Coefficient = B / total_at_typical
        infil_obj.Velocity_Term_Coefficient = C / total_at_typical
        infil_obj.Velocity_Squared_Term_Coefficient = D / total_at_typical
    else:
        # Fallback to constant
        infil_obj.Constant_Term_Coefficient = 1.0
        infil_obj.Temperature_Term_Coefficient = 0.0
        infil_obj.Velocity_Term_Coefficient = 0.0
        infil_obj.Velocity_Squared_Term_Coefficient = 0.0
```

### Fix for VENT_010: Schedule Logic
```python
# In schedule_lookup.py, fix non-residential infiltration:
"Office Function": {
    "infiltration": {
        "weekday": [(0, 6, (0.90, 1.00)),    # High when unoccupied
                    (6, 7, (0.60, 0.80)),    # Transition
                    (7, 18, (0.05, 0.15)),   # VERY LOW when pressurized
                    (18, 19, (0.40, 0.60)),  # Transition
                    (19, 24, (0.90, 1.00))], # High when unoccupied
        "weekend": [(0, 24, (0.95, 1.00))],  # High all day
    }
},
```

### Fix for VENT_012: DSOA Method
```python
# In add_ventilation.py, around line 220:
if system_type == "D":
    dsoa_obj = idf.newidfobject("DESIGNSPECIFICATION:OUTDOORAIR", Name=dsoa_object_name_global)
    dsoa_obj.Outdoor_Air_Method = "Flow/Area"  # CORRECT METHOD
    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

### Fix for VENT_013: Natural Ventilation
```python
# In create_ventilation_systems.py, for natural ventilation:
if chosen_vent_type_from_config == "Natural":
    # Natural ventilation should vary with conditions
    vobj.Constant_Term_Coefficient = 0.0
    vobj.Temperature_Term_Coefficient = 0.05  # Opens more with temp difference
    vobj.Velocity_Term_Coefficient = 0.10   # Wind-driven ventilation
    vobj.Velocity_Squared_Term_Coefficient = 0.02
else:
    # Mechanical ventilation is constant
    vobj.Constant_Term_Coefficient = 1.0
    vobj.Temperature_Term_Coefficient = 0.0
    vobj.Velocity_Term_Coefficient = 0.0
    vobj.Velocity_Squared_Term_Coefficient = 0.0
```

### Fix for VENT_015: Zone Minimum Ventilation
```python
# In add_ventilation.py, after calculating zone ventilation:
# Add minimum ventilation check
min_vent_per_zone_m3_s = 0.01  # 10 L/s minimum per zone
if ventilation_for_this_zone_m3_s < min_vent_per_zone_m3_s and ventilation_for_this_zone_m3_s > 0:
    print(f"[VENT] Zone {zone_name_curr} below minimum ventilation. Adjusting from {ventilation_for_this_zone_m3_s:.6f} to {min_vent_per_zone_m3_s:.6f} m3/s")
    ventilation_for_this_zone_m3_s = min_vent_per_zone_m3_s
```

## Validation Checklist

After implementing these fixes, validate:

1. **Infiltration Rates**:
   - Perimeter zones: 0.0003-0.0010 mÂ³/s/mÂ²
   - Core zones: 0.0001-0.0003 mÂ³/s/mÂ²
   - Should vary with outdoor conditions

2. **Ventilation Rates**:
   - Residential: ~0.0009 mÂ³/s/mÂ² (0.9 L/s/mÂ²)
   - Offices: ~0.0010 mÂ³/s/mÂ² during operation
   - Should follow schedule patterns

3. **Natural Ventilation**:
   - Should increase with temperature difference
   - Should increase with wind speed
   - Not constant throughout simulation

4. **System D (Balanced)**:
   - DSOA properly configured
   - IdealLoads shows outdoor air energy impact
   - HRV reduces heating/cooling loads

5. **Schedule Patterns**:
   - Ventilation high during occupied hours
   - Infiltration low during HVAC operation
   - Distinct weekday/weekend patterns

These deeper fixes address the mathematical errors, logic inversions, and system-specific issues that were causing unrealistic simulation results. The ventilation system should now properly model the complex interactions between infiltration, natural ventilation, and mechanical ventilation systems.

```

## 3. Critical Values to Verify

### 3.1 Infiltration Rates
**Check Design_Flow_Rate values in ZONEINFILTRATION objects:**

- **Residential (1992-2005)**: 
  - Expected base rate @ 10Pa: 0.8-1.2 L/s/mÂ²
  - Year factor: ~1.0-1.2
  - Converted to 1Pa: ~0.25-0.38 L/s/mÂ² = 0.00025-0.00038 mÂ³/s/mÂ²

- **Non-residential (2015+)**:
  - Expected base rate @ 10Pa: 0.4-0.6 L/s/mÂ²
  - Year factor: ~0.8-1.0
  - Converted to 1Pa: ~0.10-0.19 L/s/mÂ² = 0.00010-0.00019 mÂ³/s/mÂ²

### 3.2 Ventilation Rates
**Check Design_Flow_Rate values in ZONEVENTILATION objects:**

- **Residential**: 
  - Base rate: 0.9 L/s/mÂ² = 0.0009 mÂ³/s/mÂ²
  - With f_ctrl factor applied
  - Minimum total: 126 mÂ³/h = 0.035 mÂ³/s for the building

- **Non-residential (Meeting Function)**:
  - Base rate: 1.0 L/s/mÂ² = 0.001 mÂ³/s/mÂ²
  - With f_ctrl factor applied

### 3.3 System Type Verification
Check Ventilation_Type field:
- System A: "Natural"
- System B: "Intake" 
- System C: "Exhaust"
- System D: Uses IdealLoadsAirSystem

## 4. Schedule Verification

### 4.1 Archetype-Specific Schedules
Your system creates unique schedules per building type:
- `InfilSched_TwoandahalfstoryHouse` (residential infiltration)
- `VentSched_TwoandahalfstoryHouse` (residential ventilation)
- `InfilSched_MeetingFunction` (non-residential infiltration)
- `VentSched_MeetingFunction` (non-residential ventilation)

### 4.2 Schedule Patterns to Check
Verify SCHEDULE:COMPACT objects have:
- Proper day type rules (Weekdays, Weekends, etc.)
- Reasonable hourly values (0.0-1.0 for fraction schedules)
- Different patterns for residential vs non-residential

## 5. Results Validation

### 5.1 Key Output Variables
Check these in your results CSV:
1. **Zone Infiltration Standard Density Volume Flow Rate [mÂ³/s]**
   - Should vary with outdoor conditions if weather-dependent
   - Core zones should have 0 infiltration
   - Perimeter zones should have positive values

2. **Zone Mechanical Ventilation Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]**
   - Convert to mÂ³/s by dividing by 1.2 kg/mÂ³
   - Should follow ventilation schedules
   - System D zones should show balanced flows

3. **Zone Air Heat Balance Outdoor Air Transfer Rate [W]**
   - Indicates energy impact of ventilation/infiltration
   - Should correlate with flow rates and temperature differences

### 5.2 Validation Checks

**For Residential Building (30 mÂ²):**
- Total infiltration: ~7.5-11.4 mÂ³/h (0.25-0.38 L/s/mÂ² Ã 30 mÂ²)
- Total ventilation: â¥126 mÂ³/h minimum
- Combined ACH: Calculate total flow / (area Ã height)

**For Non-residential Buildings (120 mÂ² each):**
- Total infiltration: ~12-23 mÂ³/h per building
- Total ventilation: ~432 mÂ³/h per building (with f_ctrl = 1.0)
- Check HRV effectiveness impact on heating/cooling loads

## 6. Common Issues to Check

### 6.1 Infiltration Issues
- [ ] Core zones should have zero infiltration
- [ ] Weather coefficients properly set for weather-dependent model
- [ ] Flow exponent = 0.67 (standard value)
- [ ] System D infiltration reduction factor applied correctly

### 6.2 Ventilation Issues
- [ ] Fan parameters match system type (0 Pa for natural, 40-160 Pa for mechanical)
- [ ] f_ctrl factor properly applied to base rates
- [ ] Minimum residential ventilation enforced (126 mÂ³/h)
- [ ] DSOA objects created for System D with correct flow/area values

### 6.3 Schedule Issues
- [ ] All referenced schedules exist in IDF
- [ ] Schedule values are fractions (0-1) not percentages
- [ ] Different patterns for weekday/weekend if applicable
- [ ] AlwaysOnSched exists as fallback

## 7. Filtration Considerations

While your code doesn't explicitly model filtration, it's implicitly handled through:
1. **System efficiency parameters** (fan_total_efficiency)
2. **Pressure rise values** (higher pressure can indicate filter presence)
3. **HRV effectiveness** (some HRV units include filtration)

To add explicit filtration modeling, consider:
- Adding pressure drop calculations for filters
- Modifying fan power calculations to account for filter resistance
- Using EnergyPlus AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem for detailed filtration

## 8. Debugging Commands

### Check IDF Objects
```python
# List all infiltration objects
for obj in idf.idfobjects['ZONEINFILTRATION:DESIGNFLOWRATE']:
    print(f"{obj.Name}: {obj.Design_Flow_Rate} mÂ³/s/mÂ²")

# List all ventilation objects  
for obj in idf.idfobjects['ZONEVENTILATION:DESIGNFLOWRATE']:
    print(f"{obj.Name}: Type={obj.Ventilation_Type}, Flow={obj.Design_Flow_Rate}")

# Check IdealLoads settings
for obj in idf.idfobjects['ZONEHVAC:IDEALLOADSAIRSYSTEM']:
    print(f"{obj.Name}: HRV={obj.Heat_Recovery_Type}, Eff={obj.Sensible_Heat_Recovery_Effectiveness}")
```

### Validate Results
```python
# Check infiltration rates
infil_vars = df[df['VariableName'].str.contains('Infiltration Standard Density Volume Flow Rate')]
print(infil_vars.groupby('BuildingID')[['01/01', '07/01']].mean())

# Check ventilation rates
vent_vars = df[df['VariableName'].str.contains('Mechanical Ventilation Mass Flow Rate')]
vent_m3s = vent_vars[['01/01', '07/01']] / 1.2  # Convert kg/s to mÂ³/s
print(vent_m3s.groupby('BuildingID').mean())
```

## 9. Recommendations

1. **Verify zone areas**: Ensure Floor_Area in ZONE objects matches expected values
2. **Check zone naming**: Core zones should contain "_core" in name for zero infiltration
3. **Validate schedules**: Plot schedule values to ensure reasonable patterns
4. **Compare systems**: Buildings with same type should have similar parameters
5. **Energy balance**: Check that outdoor air heat transfer correlates with flow rates
6. **Seasonal variation**: Infiltration should vary between summer/winter if weather-dependent

This comprehensive check will ensure your ventilation and infiltration systems are properly implemented and producing realistic results.
